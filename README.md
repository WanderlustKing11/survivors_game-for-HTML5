# Survivors Game - HTML5 Edition

Welcome to **Survivors Game**, a top-down 2D shooter where your survival skills are put to the test! This game is a work in progress, starting as a game development project to learn and grow while sharing each step with the community. As the project evolves, expect exciting new features, mechanics, and challenges to keep you on your toes.

## Game Description

**Survivors Game** is a 2D shooter where you fend off infinite waves of enemies, trying to survive as long as possible. Your current mission: survive the onslaught with limited resources and no boundaries to hold you back. The game ends when your health is depleted, but future updates will introduce score tracking, enemy waves, and a variety of enemy and weapon types to spice up the gameplay.

### Features

- **Top-Down 2D Shooter**: Navigate through an open map with no boundaries—move freely in any direction as you face relentless enemy spawns.
- **Infinite Spawns**: Enemies currently spawn endlessly, challenging you to survive as long as you can. This will evolve into wave-based attacks with a score system.
- **Desktop and Mobile Controls**: On desktop, use the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys to move. For mobile users, an integrated joystick provides smooth control in your browser.
- **Ongoing Development**: This project is in its early stages. Planned features include loot drops, different enemy and weapon types, score tracking, and map boundaries.
